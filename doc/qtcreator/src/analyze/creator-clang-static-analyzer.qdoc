    \title Using Clang Tools

    \QC integrates the following Clang tools for finding problems in C, C++, and
    Objective-C source code by using static analysis:

    \list

        \li \l{https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/}{Clang-Tidy}, which
            has diagnostics and fixes for typical programming errors,
            such as style violations or interface misuse.

        \li \l{https://github.com/KDE/clazy/blob/master/README.md}{Clazy}, which
            helps Clang understand Qt semantics. It displays Qt related compiler
            warnings, ranging from unnecessary memory allocation to misuse of
            API and has refactoring actions for fixing some of the issues.

    \endlist

    \note The Clang static analyzer checks are a part of Clang-Tidy. To use
    the checks, you must create a custom configuration for the Clang tools and
    enable them for Clang-Tidy.

    \QC comes with the Clang tools, so you do not need to set them up separately.

    In addition to running the tools to collect diagnostics, you can select
    \inlineimage icons/open.png
    to load diagnostics from \l{https://yaml.org/}{YAML} files that you exported
    using the \c {-export fixes} option.

    \section1 Running Clang-Tidy and Clazy

    To run Clang-Tidy or Clazy to analyze the currently open file:

    \list
        \li Select the \inlineimage icons/debugger_singleinstructionmode.png
            (\uicontrol {Analyze File}) button on the editor toolbar, and then
            select the tool: \uicontrol {Clang-Tidy} or \uicontrol {Clazy}.
        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol {C++} >
            \uicontrol {Analyze Current File with Clang-Tidy} or
            \uicontrol {Analyze Current File with Clazy}.
    \endlist

    To run Clang-Tidy or Clazy to analyze an open project:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Analyze > \uicontrol {Clang-Tidy} or
            \uicontrol {Clazy}.

        \li Select the files to apply the checks to.

            \image qtcreator-files-to-analyze.webp {Files to Analyze dialog}

        \li Select \uicontrol Analyze to start the checks.

    \endlist

    The \uicontrol {Clang-Tidy} or \uicontrol {Clazy} view shows the issues:

    \image qtcreator-clang-tidy-view.webp {Clang-Tidy view}

    \note If you select \uicontrol Debug in the mode selector to open the
    \uicontrol Debug mode and then select \uicontrol {Clang-Tidy} or
    \uicontrol {Clazy}, you must select the
    \inlineimage icons/qtcreator-analyze-start-button.png
    (\uicontrol Start) button to open the \uicontrol {Files to Analyze} dialog.

    Double-click an issue to move to the location where the issue appears in
    the code editor.

    If a fixit exists for an issue, you can select the check box next to the
    issue to schedule it for fixing. Select the \uicontrol {Select Fixits}
    check box to select all fixits. To see the status of an issue, hover the
    mouse pointer over the icon next to the check box.

    To see more information about an issue that is marked with the
    \inlineimage icons/refactormarker.png
    icon, hover the mouse pointer over the line.

    To disable checks of a particular type either globally or for a
    particular project, select \uicontrol {Disable This Check} or
    \uicontrol {Disable These Checks} in the context menu.

    Select the \inlineimage icons/settings.png
    button to customize Clang diagnostics for the current project.

    \image qtcreator-clang-tools-options-customized.png {Clang Tools customized settings}

    To restore the global settings, select \uicontrol {Restore Global Settings}.
    To view and modify the global settings, select the link in
    \uicontrol {Use global settings}. To open the Clang static analyzer,
    select \uicontrol {Go to Analyzer}.

    \section1 Configuring Clang Tools

    To configure Clang diagnostics globally for Clang tools:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol Analyzer >
            \uicontrol {Clang Tools}.

            \image qtcreator-clang-tools-options.png {Clang Tools preferences}

        \li In the \uicontrol Clang-Tidy and \uicontrol Clazy-Standalone fields,
            set the paths to the executables to use.

        \li To build the project before running the Clang tools, select the
            \uicontrol {Build the project before analysis} check box. The Clang
            tools do not require that you build the project before analysis, but
            they might display misleading warnings about files missing that are
            generated during the build. For big projects, not building the
            project might save some time.

        \li To disable automatic analysis of open documents, deselect the
            \uicontrol {Analyze open files} check box.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Parallel jobs} field, select the number of jobs
            to run in parallel to make the analysis faster on multi-core
            processors.

        \li The \uicontrol {Diagnostic configuration} field shows the
            checks to perform. Click the value of the field to open the
            \uicontrol {Diagnostic Configurations} dialog, where you can
            select and edit the checks to perform.

            \image qtcreator-clang-tools-diagnostics-configuration.png {Diagnostics Configuration dialog}

        \li Select \uicontrol Copy to copy the selected diagnostics for editing.

            \image qtcreator-clang-copy-diagnostic-configuration.png {Copy Diagnostic Configuration dialog}

        \li In the \uicontrol {Diagnostic configuration name} field, give the
            configuration a name, and then select \uicontrol OK.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Clang Warnings} tab, select the
            \uicontrol {Use diagnostic flags from the build system} check box
            to forward diagnostic flags, such as warning flags, from the build
            system to the Clang code model for displaying annotations in the
            code editor.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Clang-Tidy Checks} tab, select
            \uicontrol {Select Checks} to select the checks to perform.
            To filter the checks, enter a string in the
            \uicontrol {Filter by name} field.

            \image qtcreator-clang-tidy.png {Clang-Tidy Checks tab}

            For more information about the available checkers, see
            \l{https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/available_checks.html}
            {Clang Static Analyzer documentation}.

        \li To edit the selected check as plain text, select
            \uicontrol {Edit Checks as String}.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Clazy Checks} tab, select the level of Clazy
            checks to perform.

            \image qtcreator-clazy.png {Clazy Checks tab}

        \li In the \uicontrol Filters field, select topics to view
            only checks related to those areas in the \uicontrol Checks field.
            To filter the checks in the selected areas, enter a string in the
            \uicontrol {Filter by name} field.

        \li To view all checks again, select \uicontrol {Reset Filter}.

        \li To view more information about the checks online, select the
            \uicontrol {Web Page} links next to them.

    \endlist

    To suppress diagnostics, select \uicontrol {Suppress This Diagnostic} in the
    context menu. To view the suppression list for a project and to remove
    diagnostics from it, select \uicontrol Projects >
    \uicontrol {Project Settings} > \uicontrol {Clang Tools}.

    \section2 Selecting Clazy Check Levels

    The Clazy checks are divided into levels from 0 to 3. The checks at level 0
    are very stable and show hardly any false positives, while the checks at
    level 3 are experimental. You can select the checks to perform
    at each level. To include the checks from the lower levels automatically,
    select the \uicontrol {Enable lower levels automatically} check box.

    \section2 Creating Clang-Tidy Configuration Files

    Clang-Tidy reads the configuration for each source file from a .clang-tidy
    file located in the closest parent directory of the source file. If any
    configuration options have a corresponding command-line option, the
    command-line option takes precedence. The effective configuration can be
    inspected using \c {-dump-config}.

    \QC creates the configuration for you based on the checks you select. To
    store the checks in file format, you can create a .clang-tidy file, as
    follows:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol {Edit Checks as String} and copy the contents of
            the field.
        \li Pipe the output of \c {clang-tidy -dump-config} into a file named
            \c {.clang-tidy}. For example:
            \c {clang-tidy -checks=-*,bugprone-*,cppcoreguidelines-avoid-* -dump-config > .clang-tidy}
        \li Move the .clang-tidy file to the parent directory of the sources.
    \endlist

    To add more checks using \QC later on, copy the checks from your .clang-tidy
    file into the \uicontrol {Edit Checks as String} field, select additional
    checks, and copy-paste the contents of the field to the .clang-tidy file.
