    \title Boot2Qt Run Settings

    \brief Settings for running applications on Boot2Qt devices.

    Specify settings for running applications on the \l {Kits}{Run device} that
    you select for a kit in \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Build & Run} >
    \uicontrol Run > \uicontrol {Run Settings}.

    To run and debug an application on a \l Boot2Qt device (commercial only), you
    must create connections from the development host to the device and add the
    device configurations to kits. Select \uicontrol {Manage Kits} to add devices
    to kits. For more information, see
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/Boot2Qt/b2qt-installation-guides.html}
    {Boot2Qt: Installation Guide}.

    The run settings display the path to the executable file on the development
    host and on the device.
