    \section1 Running on Remote Linux Devices

    To build the application and run it on a device:

        \list 1

            \li Specify a connection to the device. For more information, see
                \l{Connecting Remote Linux Devices}.

            \li Click the \uicontrol Run button.

        \endlist

    \QC uses the compiler specified in the project build settings
    (tool chain) to build the application.

    \QC copies the application files to the connected device and runs the
    application. The application views are
    displayed on the device. Command-line output is visible in the \QC
    \uicontrol {Application Output} view.

    In the \uicontrol {Projects} mode, select the remote Linux kit and then
    select \uicontrol {Run} to view the settings for deploying the application
    to the connected device. For more information, see
    \l{Remote Linux Run Settings}.

    Debugging works transparently if GDB server is installed on the device and
    it is compatible with the GDB on the host.
