        \li \l{Finding and Replacing}

            The incremental search highlights the matching strings in the
            window while typing and the advanced search enables you to
            search from currently open projects or files on the file system.
            You can conduct incremental and advanced searches in parallel.

            In addition, you can search for symbols when you want to
            refactor code.

        \li \l{Searching with the Locator}

            Use the locator to browse
            through projects, files, classes, functions, documentation and
            file systems.

        \li \l{Jump to the Code}

            Jump to the code for a specific component directly from
            the \uicontrol {2D} view or \uicontrol {Navigator} view.
            You can also jump to the code of a particular
            \uicontrol {State} or \uicontrol {Connection} from their
            corresponding views.
