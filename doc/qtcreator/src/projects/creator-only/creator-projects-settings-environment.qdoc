    \title Specify the environment for projects

    The environment for a project is determined according to a settings hierarchy:

    \image qtcreator-environment-settings-hierarchy.webp {Environment settings hierarchy}

    By default, the environment in which \QC was started is used and modified
    to include the Qt version. Depending on the selected Qt version, \QC
    automatically sets the necessary environment variables. You can edit
    existing environment variables or add, reset and unset new variables
    based on your project requirements.

    The final environment is specified separately for each kit. With
    project-specific environment settings you can change the environment for
    all kits that you use to build, deploy, and run the project simultaneously,
    rather than having to change it separately for each kit.

    The changes are stored in the local project-specific \c{CMakeLists.txt.user}
    or \c{.pro.user} file, depending on the build system you use, such as CMake
    or qmake. Therefore, they are not suitable for sharing between developers or
    development PCs. To share settings, incorporate them into the build system.
    For example, if you use CMake, make the changes in the \c {CMakeLists.txt}
    file, and if you use qmake, make the changes in the \c{.pro} file.

    \section1 Globally change the environment

    To globally change the environment from the one in which \QC is started,
    select \preferences > \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol System, and then
    select \uicontrol Change in the \uicontrol Environment field.

    \section1 Change the environment for a project

    To change the system environment for a project from the one in which
    \QC is started, select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Project Settings}
    > \uicontrol Environment.

    \image qtcreator-projects-environment.webp {Environment tab in Project Settings}

    \section1 Specify the build environment

    Specify the build environment to use for a kit in \uicontrol Projects >
    \uicontrol {Build Settings} > \uicontrol {Build Environment}.

    \section2 Clear the build environment

    To build with a clean system environment, select the \uicontrol {Clear
    system environment} check box. \QC discards the current environment, and
    populates a clean system environment with the environment variables that
    the compilers and tools need. Therefore, the environment is never totally
    empty, even after you clear it.

    \section1 Specify the run environment

    \QC automatically selects the environment used for running the application
    based on the \l{glossary-device}{device} type. You can edit the environment
    or select another environment in \uicontrol Projects >
    \uicontrol {Run Settings} > \uicontrol {Environment}.

    You can edit existing environment variables or add, reset and unset new
    variables.

    \image qtcreator-run-environment.png {Environment section in Run Settings}

    When running on the desktop, the \uicontrol {Build Environment} is used by
    default, but you can also use the \uicontrol {System Environment} without the
    additions made to the build environment.

    To modify the environment variable values for the run environment,
    double-click environment variables or their values and change them inline,
    or select \uicontrol {Batch Edit} to change several variable values at a
    time.

    \section2 Clean the run environment

    To run in a clean system environment, select \uicontrol {Clean Environment}.

    \section2 Run on devices

    When running on a mobile device connected to the development host, \QC
    fetches information about the \uicontrol {Device Environment} from the device.
    Usually, it does not make sense to edit the device environment.

    \title Batch edit environment settings

    You can change the environment variable values for build or run environments
    either for a particular project or globally for all projects in the
    \uicontrol {Edit Environment} dialog:

    \list
        \li To change values globally, select \uicontrol Change in the
            \l {Globally change the environment}{global environment preferences}.
        \li To change values for a project, select \uicontrol {Batch Edit} in the
            \l {Change the environment for a project}{project},
            \l {Specify the build environment}{build}, or
            \l {Specify the run environment}{run} environment settings.
    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-edit-environment.webp {Edit Environment dialog}

    Use the following syntax to enter environment variable names and values:
    \c {<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>}.

    To remove a variable value from the environment, enter the variable name.
    For example, \c TEST sets the value of the \c TEST variable empty when
    building or running the project.

    To add a variable value to the environment, enter the variable name and
    value, separated by the equals sign. For example, the following line
    prepends the \c /opt/bin folder to the existing PATH:

    \list
        \li On Windows: \c {PATH=C:\opt\bin;${PATH}}
        \li On Linux: \c {PATH=/opt/bin:${PATH}}
    \endlist

    To add or remove several variables, place them on separate lines. The order
    is important. If you remove a value on a line, you cannot refer to it on the
    following lines. However, you can remove a value after you have referred to
    it on an earlier line.

    To temporarily disable a variable, add a hash character (#) to the beginning
    of the line.
